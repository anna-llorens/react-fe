# ⚛️ My testing app

 The idea of this repo is to keep track of development tests. 
  There is no specific functionality beyond a resource that I can easily come back and check. 
## ⚙️ Requirements
- Node 14+
- Yarn 1.22+

## 🚀 Getting started
Start the React App:

```sh
> cd app
> yarn && yarn start    # install dependecies and run the app 
```

Start the Graphql-server:

```sh
> cd graphql-server
> yarn && yarn start    # install dependecies and run the app 
```
